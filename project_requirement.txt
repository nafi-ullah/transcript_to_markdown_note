I want to create a ai agent in python, where I will pass a transcript of a lecture video.
the scripts contains time stamp and the voice timestamp.
also I will pass the modules of that video transcript.

every module should have a markdown file .md.
if there are 5 module, then create 5 markdown .md file.
every file contians the notes of that module.
suppose, 1st module duration start from 0:0:01 and ends at 1:10:10
you have to  pass every 10 minutes transcript to gpt chat completition api. it should response the markdown format note of that 10 minutes.
if the module 1 hour, the chat gpt api will call 60/10 = 6 times. every time it will generate notes and concat the note in that modules markdown file.


for example module.txt:
(00:03:25) Module 1: Machine Learning Fundamentals 
(00:30:08) Module 2: Introduction to TensorFlow
(01:00:00) Module 3: Core Learning Algorithms
(02:45:39) Module 4: Neural Networks with TensorFlow
(03:43:10) Module 5: Deep Computer Vision - Convolutional Neural Networks
(04:40:44) Module 6: Natural Language Processing with RNNs
(06:08:00) Module 7: Reinforcement Learning with Q-Learning
(06:48:24) Module 8: Conclusion and Next Steps

here Module 1 is from 00:03:25 to 00:30:08. and the module name is Machine Learning Fundamentals 
so a markdown file named "1 Machine Learning Fundamentals.md" file will be created in notes folder.
here in this module's file chat gpt will get transcript from transcript.txt file 00:03:25 to 00:13:25 duration.(if 00:13:25 is not exist then use most near times. like 00:13:35) it will return the note of this durations transcript.
after that it will generate another note from 13:26 to 23:26 duration from the transcript. and this note will be concat with prevous note, as these are in same module.


when 30:08 end, it will create another markdown file .md it will take note same way of its module's transcripts.
as there are module, it should have 8 markdwon files.
gpt api key will be provided in env.
