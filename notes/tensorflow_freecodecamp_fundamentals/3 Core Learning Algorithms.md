## Linear Regression

### Overview

- **Definition**: A basic form of machine learning that establishes a linear relationship between data points.
- **Purpose**: Predicts outcomes based on input data by fitting a line (line of best fit) through data points.

### Key Concepts

- **Line of Best Fit**: A line that best represents the relationship between data points in a scatterplot.
  - **Use**: Predicts new data points by extending the line.
  - **Example**: Given an x-value, predict the corresponding y-value using the line.

### Example

- **Graph**: A plot using `matplotlib` shows data points and a line of best fit.
- **Prediction**: For a given x-value, the line predicts the y-value.
- **Dimensionality**: 
  - Basic example: 2D (x and y).
  - Complex scenarios: Multi-dimensional data (e.g., predicting a student's final grade based on multiple midterm grades).

### Mathematical Representation

- **Equation**: \( y = mx + b \)
  - **\( m \)**: Slope of the line.
  - **\( b \)**: Y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis).
  - **\( x, y \)**: Coordinates of a data point.

### Calculating the Slope

- **Slope (m)**: Represents the steepness of the line.
  - **Formula**: Rise over run (vertical change divided by horizontal change).
  - **Example**: Draw a right-angled triangle on the line to calculate the slope.

### Practical Example

- **Equation**: \( y = 1.5x + 0.5 \)
  - **Prediction**: If \( x = 2 \), then \( y = 3.5 \).
  - **Reverse Calculation**: Given a y-value, rearrange the equation to solve for x.

### Higher Dimensions

- **Application**: Linear regression can be extended to multiple dimensions, allowing predictions based on multiple input variables.

## Conclusion

- **Understanding Linear Regression**: Provides a foundational understanding necessary for more complex algorithms.
- **Practical Use**: Widely applicable in scenarios where data points exhibit a linear relationship.

## Chunk 2 (1:10:00 - 1:20:00)

# Core Learning Algorithms: Linear Regression and Data Preparation

## Overview

In this segment, we explore the concept of linear regression, its application in predicting outcomes based on input variables, and the initial steps to prepare a dataset for modeling using Python libraries.

## Linear Regression

### Key Concepts

- **Linear Regression**: A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
- **Dimensions**: In linear regression, data can be visualized in multiple dimensions, typically involving multiple input variables and a single output variable.

### Application in 3D

- When data points are linearly correlated in three dimensions (x, y, z), a line of best fit can be established.
- The equation of this line allows prediction of one variable if the other two are known.
- **Example**: Given x and y, predict z.

### Examples of Linear Regression

- **Predicting Grades**: Assuming a correlation between initial and final grades.
- **Life Expectancy**: Predicting life expectancy based on age or health conditions.

### Importance of Correlation

- Linear regression is suitable when there is a linear correlation between variables.

## Chunk 3 (1:20:00 - 1:30:00)

# Core Learning Algorithms: Data Preparation and Exploration

## Introduction
In this segment, we focus on preparing and exploring data for machine learning models, particularly using pandas data frames. We discuss the importance of separating data into training and testing sets to ensure unbiased model evaluation.

## Key Concepts

### Data Splitting
- **Training and Testing Data**: 
  - It is crucial to test a model on fresh data to avoid bias and ensure it hasn't simply memorized the training data.
  - **Training Data**: Used to train the model.
  - **Testing Data**: Used to evaluate the model's performance.

### Data Handling with Pandas
- **Pandas DataFrame**: 
  - A data structure that allows for easy manipulation and analysis of data.
  - Preferred over lists or NumPy arrays for its ability to reference specific columns and rows.

### DataFrame Operations
- **Loading Data**: 
  - Data is loaded into a DataFrame using `read_csv`.
- **Viewing Data**: 
  - `df.head()`: Displays the first five entries of the DataFrame.
- **Column Manipulation**:
  - `df.pop(column_name)`: Removes and returns a specified column from the DataFrame.

## Practical Example

### Data Preparation
1. **Loading Data**:
   - Import necessary libraries like TensorFlow and pandas.
   - Load CSV data into a DataFrame.
   
2. **Separating Features and Labels**:
   - Extract the 'Survived' column from the training and evaluation datasets:
     ```python
     y_train = df_train.pop('Survived')
     y_eval = df_eval.pop('Survived')
     ```
   - This separates the target variable (labels) from the input features.

3. **Inspecting Data**:
   - Use `df.head()` to view the structure and initial entries of the DataFrame.
   - Check the shape of the DataFrame using `df.shape` to understand the dimensions.

### Data Exploration
- **Descriptive Statistics**:
  - `df.describe()`: Provides a summary of statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and count for each column.
  
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Histograms and plots help visualize data distribution and potential biases:
    - **Age Distribution**: Most passengers are in their 20s and 30s.
    - **Gender Distribution**: More males than females.
    - **Class Distribution**: Most passengers are in third class.
    - **Survival Rate by Gender**: Females have a higher survival rate (~78%) compared to males (~20%).

## Summary
- **Data Preparation**: Involves loading data, separating features and labels, and splitting into training and testing sets.
- **Data Exploration**: Involves using descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand data characteristics and potential biases.

Understanding these steps is crucial for building effective machine learning models, as it ensures the model is trained and evaluated on appropriate data, leading to more reliable predictions.


## Chunk 4 (1:30:00 - 1:40:00)

# Core Learning Algorithms: Feature Columns and Data Preparation

## Introduction to Feature Columns
- **Feature Columns**: Essential components in machine learning models used to define how data should be represented.
- **Categorical vs. Numeric Data**:
  - **Categorical Data**: Non-numeric data with specific categories (e.g., gender, class).
  - **Numeric Data**: Data that consists of integer or float values (e.g., age, fare).

## Handling Categorical Data
- **Encoding Categorical Data**: Transform non-numeric data into numeric form for model processing.
  - Example: Encode "male" as `1` and "female" as `0`.
  - Class categories like "first", "second", "third" can be encoded as `0`, `1`, `2` respectively.
  - The order of encoding is arbitrary as long as consistency is maintained.

### Steps for Encoding
1. **Identify Categorical Columns**: Determine which columns contain categorical data.
2. **Encode Using Integer Values**: Assign unique integers to each category within a column.
3. **TensorFlow Handling**: TensorFlow can automatically handle encoding in version 2.0 and above.

## Numeric Columns
- **Definition**: Columns that already contain numeric values.
- **Examples**: Age, fare.
- **Preparation**: Simply define these columns without additional transformation.

## Creating Feature Columns
- **Purpose**: To prepare data for feeding into a linear estimator or model.
- **Process**:
  1. **Define Categorical and Numeric Columns**: Hardcode these based on your dataset.
  2. **Create Feature Columns**:
     - Initialize an empty list for feature columns.
     - Loop through each categorical column to define its vocabulary using unique values.
     - Append each feature column to the list using TensorFlow's `categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list`.

### Example Code
```python
feature_columns = []
for feature_name in categorical_columns:
    vocabulary = df_train[feature_name].unique()
    feature_columns.append(tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(feature_name, vocabulary))
```

## Training Process Overview
- **Batching**: Load data in small batches to manage memory usage and improve processing speed.
  - Typical batch size: 32 entries.
- **Epochs**: Number of times the model sees the entire dataset.
  - Purpose: Improve model accuracy by allowing multiple passes over the data.
  - Risk of **Overfitting**: Too many epochs can lead to memorization rather than learning.

### Key Concepts
- **Batch Size**: Number of data points processed at once.
- **Epochs**: Total passes over the entire dataset.
- **Overfitting**: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.

## Conclusion
- Feature columns are crucial for preparing data for machine learning models.
- Proper encoding and handling of categorical and numeric data are essential steps.
- Understanding the training process, including batching and epochs, helps in building efficient models.

These notes provide a structured overview of feature columns and data preparation in machine learning, focusing on practical steps and key concepts for effective model training.

# Core Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression and Classification

## Overview

In this segment, we delve into the process of making predictions using logistic regression and transition into the concept of classification. We explore how to interpret prediction results, manipulate data structures, and prepare datasets for classification tasks.

## Key Concepts

### Logistic Regression Predictions

- **Data Structure**: Predictions are returned as a list of dictionaries, each representing a prediction.

2. **Interpreting Probabilities**:
   - Two classes: 0 (did not survive) and 1 (survived).
   - Example: If `probabilities` are `[0.033, 0.96]`, then:
     - Probability of not surviving: 3.3%
     - Probability of surviving: 96%

3. **Looping Through Predictions**:
   - Iterate over the list of dictionaries to print probabilities for each prediction.

### Evaluating Predictions

- **Example Evaluation**:
  - Use `df_eval.loc[index]` to retrieve the original data for a specific prediction.
  - Compare predicted probabilities with actual outcomes from `y_eval.loc[index]`.

- **Accuracy Considerations**:
  - Example: A prediction might show a 32% chance of survival, but the actual outcome was survival, indicating model inaccuracies.

## Transition to Classification

## Chunk 9 (2:20:00 - 2:30:00)

# Core Learning Algorithms: Clustering and Hidden Markov Models

## K-Means Clustering

### Overview
- **K-Means Clustering** is a method used to partition a dataset into distinct groups or clusters.
- Each cluster is represented by a **centroid**, which is the mean position of all the points in the cluster.

### Process
1. **Initialization**: Choose the number of clusters, `k`, and initialize `k` centroids randomly.
2. **Assignment**: 
   - For each data point, calculate the distance to all centroids.
   - Assign the data point to the closest centroid.
3. **Update**:
   - Move each centroid to the center of mass of its assigned points.
4. **Iteration**:
   - Repeat the assignment and update steps until centroids no longer move significantly.

### Example
- **Data Points**: Assign each point to the nearest centroid.
- **Reassignment**: Reassign points if a centroid moves.
- **Convergence**: Process stops when no points change clusters.

### Considerations
- **Number of Clusters (`k`)**: Must be predefined, though some algorithms can estimate the optimal `k`.
- **Convergence**: Achieved when centroids stabilize and points no longer change clusters.

## Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

### Overview
- **Hidden Markov Models** are statistical models that represent systems with hidden states.
- They are used to model probability distributions over sequences of observations.

### Components
1. **States**: 
   - Finite set of hidden states (e.g., hot day, cold day).
   - Transitions between states are governed by probabilities.
2. **Observations**:
   - Each state has associated observations with specific probabilities.
   - Example: Probability of being happy on a hot day.
3. **Transitions**:
   - Probabilities define the likelihood of moving from one state to another.

### Example: Weather Prediction
- **States**: Hot day, Cold day.
- **Observations**: Probability of weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy).
- **Transitions**: Likelihood of transitioning from hot to cold day, and vice versa.

### Key Concepts
- **Transition Probabilities**: Likelihood of moving between states.
- **Observation Probabilities**: Likelihood of observations given a state.
- **Hidden States**: States are not directly observed; only the observations are.

### Applications
- **Weather Modeling**: Predicting future weather based on current conditions.
- **Probability Distributions**: Using known probabilities or calculating from datasets.

### Important Terms
- **Center of Mass**: The mean position of all points in a cluster.
- **Convergence**: When the algorithm reaches a stable state with no further changes.
- **Probability Distribution**: A function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes.

### Summary
- **K-Means Clustering**: A straightforward algorithm for partitioning data into clusters based on distance to centroids.
- **Hidden Markov Models**: Complex models used for systems with hidden states, relying on probability distributions to predict outcomes.

These concepts form the basis of clustering and probabilistic modeling, providing tools for data analysis and prediction in various fields.

    1. Create a new session in TensorFlow.
    2. Run the graph part with `mean.numpy()`.
    3. Print the result to see expected values.

- **Session Execution**:
  - Use the following syntax for sessions in TensorFlow 2.x:
    ```python
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        print(mean.numpy())
    ```
  - This prints an array of expected temperatures for each day.

### Hidden Markov Models (HMM)

- **Understanding HMM**:
  - HMMs are used to predict sequences, such as temperatures over days.
  - Initial probabilities determine starting conditions (e.g., starting on a cold day).

- **Example**:
  - Starting temperature: 3 degrees.
  - Probabilities can be adjusted to see different outcomes.
  - Example probabilities:
    - Cold day followed by a hot day: 30% → Adjust to 50%.
    - Hot day followed by a cold day: 20% → Adjust to 50%.

- **Model Behavior**:
  - Re-running the model with the same probabilities yields consistent results.
  - Adjusting probabilities affects the sequence of predicted temperatures.

- **Practical Use**:
  - HMMs are useful for certain predictive tasks, though not always highly accurate for long-term predictions.
