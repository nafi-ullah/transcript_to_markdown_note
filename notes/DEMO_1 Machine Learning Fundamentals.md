[3:27] So in this first section, I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the difference between artificial intelligence, neural networks and machine learning. And the reason we need to
[3:35] go into this is because we're going to be covering all of these topics throughout this course. So it's v...

[13:26] Whereas in standard machine learning, we only have you know, one or two layers, and then artificial intelligence in general, we don't necessarily have to have like a predefined
[13:35] set of layers. Okay, so that is pretty much it for neural networks, there's one last thing I will say about...

[23:21] just so you guys kind of get the point of what we're trying to do here. So let's do that. Okay, so let's say I have this data set, this here is what we're working with.
[23:30] And we have these features, the features in this instance, are going to be x and y, right?
[23:36] So X, and Y are ...
