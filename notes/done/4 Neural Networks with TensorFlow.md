## Module 4: Neural Networks

### Overview
In this module, we will explore the following key topics related to neural networks:
- Understanding how neural networks function
- The mathematics behind neural networks
- Concepts of gradient descent and backpropagation
- Information flow within neural networks
- Practical example: Classifying articles of clothing using a neural network

### Introduction to Neural Networks
- **Purpose**: Neural networks are designed to provide classifications or predictions based on input data.
- **Black Box Concept**: 
  - Neural networks can be viewed as a "black box" that maps input data to output results.
  - This mapping is similar to a mathematical function, such as \( y = 4x \), where input \( x \) is mapped to output \( y \).

### Structure of a Neural Network
1. **Layers**:
   - **Input Layer**: 
     - The first layer that receives raw data.
     - Each piece of input data corresponds to one input neuron.
     - Example: For a 28x28 pixel image, 784 input neurons are required (28 * 28 = 784).
   - **Output Layer**:
     - Contains neurons corresponding to the output classes or values.
     - For binary classification, one output neuron with a value between 0 and 1 can be used.
     - For multi-class classification, the number of output neurons equals the number of classes, forming a probability distribution.
   - **Hidden Layers**:
     - Layers between the input and output layers.
     - Not directly observable; they process inputs to derive outputs.
     - Can have multiple hidden layers, each with various neurons.

2. **Connections and Weights**:
   - Layers are connected by **weights**, which are numeric values.
   - **Densely Connected Layers**: Every neuron in one layer connects to every neuron in the next layer.
   - Weights are trainable parameters that the neural network adjusts during training to optimize input-output mapping.

### Example Scenarios
- **Image Classification**:
  - Input: Image pixels
  - Output: Predicted class (e.g., type of clothing)
  - Input neurons correspond to each pixel; output neurons correspond to each class.

- **Single Value Prediction**:
  - Input: A single numeric value
  - Output: Predicted numeric value or class

### Important Concepts
- **Trainable Parameters**: Weights that the neural network adjusts to improve accuracy.
- **Probability Distribution**: In multi-class classification, output neurons represent probabilities for each class, summing to 1.

### Summary
Neural networks are complex systems composed of interconnected layers and weights. They function by mapping input data to outputs through a series of transformations, optimized by adjusting weights during training. Understanding the structure and function of neural networks is crucial for effectively utilizing them in tasks such as image classification and prediction.

## Neural Networks with TensorFlow: Connections, Weights, Biases, and Activation Functions

### Connections Between Neurons
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer.
  - Example: If there are 3 neurons in one layer and 2 in the next, there are 3 x 2 = 6 connections.
- **Weights (W)**: Each connection has an associated weight, which is a trainable parameter.

### Biases
- **Definition**: A bias is a constant numeric value added to the weighted sum of inputs.
- **Placement**: Exists in the layer preceding the one it affects.
- **Connection**: Each neuron in the next layer receives input from the bias, but biases do not connect with each other.
- **Weight of Bias**: Typically set to 1.

### Passing Information Through the Network
- **Input Data**: Consider data points like x, y, z, which belong to classes (e.g., red or blue).
- **Output Neuron**: Provides a value between 0 and 1 to determine class membership (e.g., closer to 0 for red, closer to 1 for blue).

### Weighted Sum
- **Calculation**: The value of a neuron is determined by the weighted sum of inputs plus the bias.
  - Formula: \( n_1 = \sum_{i=0}^{n} (w_i \times x_i) + b \)
- **Weights Initialization**: Initially random, updated during training to optimize the network.

### Activation Functions
- **Purpose**: Ensure output values are within a desired range, such as between 0 and 1.
- **Types**:
  - **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)**: Outputs zero for negative inputs and the input value for positive inputs.
  - **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)**: Squashes values between -1 and 1.
  - **Sigmoid**: Squashes values between 0 and 1, often called the "squishifier" function.
    - Formula: \( \text{Sigmoid}(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \)

### Application of Activation Functions
- **At Each Neuron**: Applied to the weighted sum plus bias before passing the value to the next neuron.
  - Formula: \( n_1 = F\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n} (w_i \times x_i) + b\right) \)
- **Output Layer**: The choice of activation function affects the range and interpretation of the output.

### Summary
